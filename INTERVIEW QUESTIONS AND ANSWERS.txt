					INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS


1)  What is IQUERIABLE,Ienumerablea nd List?



"Mam, if we use IEnumerable, we take the whole data from the database and store it in memory, then filter from this memory, which is inefficient.

And when we use ToList(), it's materialized data - it performs the filtering in the database, then the filtered data is stored in memory. If we need more filtration or querying, we use this memory.

And IQueryable, it only builds the SQL query - it does not perform the database call yet, unless we call methods like ToList(), First(), Any(), etc.Until then, we're just building the SQL query string in memory."

Mam, if we use for loop on IQueryable:

var users = db.Users.Where(x => x.Age > 18);  // IQueryable

foreach(var user in users)  // ← THIS MAKES DATABASE CALL!
{
    Console.WriteLine(user.Name);
}

What happens:

When foreach starts → Database call happens!

Database executes: SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age > 18

Returns data row by row

BUT: Connection stays open! Database is streaming data

Problem:

Slow - Database sends rows one by one

Connection stays open - Bad for performance

Can timeout if loop takes too long

.ToList() → ONE database call: SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age > 18

Gets ALL data at once into memory

Closes database connection immediately

Loop runs on memory data (fast!)
